  },
  {
    question: "How is the EcoScore calculated?",
    answer: "Our scoring engine runs an multi-tiered weighted matrix. It inspects material origin (recycled fibers vs virgin polymers getting higher points), production electricity grids, fair trade labor certifications, packaging materials, product lifespan and repair cycles, and verifies claims to detect and penalize greenwashing."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I have to pay to use EcoIntercept AI?",
    answer: "No. EcoIntercept AI is 100% free and open-source. Our mission is to democratize climate-impact transparency so millions of consumers can steer their shopping power towards environmentally aligned manufacturers without financial friction."
  },
  {
    question: "Is my personal data or shopping history kept private?",
    answer: "Absolutely. EcoIntercept is privacy-first by design. Our browser extension operates fully in client isolation. It does not track your account details, name, payment pathways, or search history. All analysis requests to our server proxy are completely anonymized."
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the carbon and greenwashing analysis?",
    answer: "Our backend leverages climate-data pipelines compiled from primary environmental product declarations (EPDs) and greenhouse gas protocols. When you consult Gemini-powered real-time analysis, the model references certified lifecycle databases to provide highly realistic offsets and flags questionable non-certified text claims."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I load an unpacked Chrome extension?",
    answer: "Open Chrome, type 'chrome://extensions/' into the address bar, and hit enter. Scroll to the top right and toggle 'Developer Mode' to green. On the top left of the dashboard. click 'Load unpacked', and select the folder you extracted from the download ZIP. The extension icon will appear immediately!"
